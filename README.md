# [Roots Wrapper Toolbar](http://roots.io/plugins/roots-wrapper-toolbar/)

The Roots Wrapper Toolbar is a WordPress plugin (or mu-plugin) that displays the base and sidebar templates selected by the [Roots wrapper](roots.io/an-introduction-to-the-roots-theme-wrapper/) in the WordPress toolbar. 

It requires the [Roots theme](http://roots.io/) and wrapper to function.

## Installation

Clone or download the repo and place into the `plugins` directory of your Roots based theme and activate.

Alternatively, copy the `roots-wrapper-toolbar.php` into your `mu-plugins` folder to prevent unwanted or accidental de-activation.
